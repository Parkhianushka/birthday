    <h1>To My Dearest Divya 💗</h1>
    <p>In the busy schedule of life, one day was decided to take an off. Of course, the day was Sunday because I wouldn’t want to waste my off day— and mere pay bhi to cut hota na agar off le leti to!</p>
    <p>That day I decided to have a little fun by myself, alone, without any company. I rested the whole day and planned to hit a crowded place where nobody would recognise me. So I went to a beach, trying to relax and just be in my own world of thoughts.</p>
    <p>I was just having me-time, and at that moment, someone approached me. He asked, “Are you alone?” I said, “Yes, how may I help you?” He replied, “No, I just wanted an unknown company… can I sit here?” I said, “Ya sure.”</p>
    <p>He sat silently. I didn’t start the conversation either.</p>
    <p>There was a group of friends enjoying themselves nearby. Watching them, he said, “Isn’t it pretty to have so many friends?” I said, “I have a bit different opinion about it.” “As in?” he asked. “I think having too many people around makes things complicated. Few close ones are enough.” “Great. And why do you think that?” “Simply my choice. Everyone has one, I guess.”</p>
    <p>At that moment, I got a call from someone very important. I excused myself.</p>
    <p>When I came back, I saw the boy with a girl. She was saying sorry. The boy came near me and said— “Thank you… because of you, my best friend understood my importance.” And they went their way.</p>
    <p>Thinking about that incident, I remembered something from my life.</p>
    <p>When I used to go to school, There was a group of my seniors I used to be around. I was a quiet kid, Living in my own world, Not knowing where life was taking me.</p>
    <p>One random day in the bus, there was some issue about seats. The seniors I used to be with started fighting… With whom? You’re curious, right? Wait yaar—story mein hero ki entry hamesha thodi dramatic hoti hai 😌</p>
    <p>So listen— She was small in height, But her words were big and bold. She clashed with everyone When things didn’t go her way.</p>
    <p>I didn’t know who she was. The fight ended. Everything settled. That was my first meeting with my hero.</p>
    <p>Of course, not all stories have a perfect timing or perfect introduction. After a few days, I randomly got to know her name—Divya.</p>
    <p>And a few more days later, I don’t know how, I started sitting next to her on the same side. Then, out of nowhere, she started talking to me (as we all know… the extrovert Divya 😄) I know I must have made a little effort too, But today, let’s give her the credit.</p>
    <p>And so began the conversations with my hero.</p>
    <p>As days passed, it became a routine—mandatory even—to sit together. Now she was my friend. A new phase of my life had unknowingly begun.</p>
    <p>In the beginning, my friend was super confident— Because of that, I started doubting myself.</p>
    <p>One day she asked, “What are even numbers?” I said, “2, 4, 6, 8…” She said, “No! It’s 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.” I said, “No yaar… that’s odd numbers!” But Divya didn’t even listen 😂</p>
    <p>Another day—she brought something in a liquid state for tiffin. Aunty allowed her to eat it in class, But Miss Divya wanted to eat it on the bus!</p>
    <p>I was okay with it—what did I care? Until… she said, “Yaar it’s not opening. Help me!” Being the good girl, I tried.</p>
    <p>The moment I opened it, The whole thing spilled on me—on my bag, my shirt… everything! I looked at her, expecting a sorry. But instead… she laughed. SO Divya 😤😂</p>
    <p>Now let’s time skip— My last year of school, 10th class. It was memorable in its own way. I left school and experienced a living hell due to a mistake I made.</p>
    <p>A year later, it was Divya’s 10th result day. I was at home and called her. She told me the result—it was a bit low.</p>
    <p>Then Aunty took the phone and said, “Anushka, she’s feeling low. Come over, please.” I went to her home.</p>
    <p>I don’t know how much peace my visit brought her… But I was there.</p>
    <p>Our birthday parties where I danced like an animal, Our late-night calls where we laughed like ghosts, Our gossips and random talks where we judged people way too hard 😆 All of it… I’m just glad that she’s part of it.</p>
    <p>That it’s <strong>us</strong>. Purely us. Just ours.</p>
    <p>You know when I realised your importance? When my so-called childhood best friend Threw me out of her life like I was nothing.</p>
    <p>I questioned my entire existence. Alone. Far away. With no one by my side.</p>
    <p>When I came back and told Divya, She said— “Bro… you don’t deserve her. You deserve way better.”</p>
    <p>I thought—fine. Let it go. I didn’t know what I needed then.</p>
    <p>My heart felt empty. That place, once full for years, Felt hollow overnight.</p>
    <p>My family was there— But I had lost my trust, my confidence, Even my school memories—to that friend.</p>
    <p>But then you came.</p>
    <p>You made me believe in myself again. You gave me confidence. You made me want to meet people. You helped me think highly of myself. You made me stronger. You taught me to love myself.</p>
    <p>Simple na? Kuch logon ke saath waqt bitane se hi sab theek lagne lagta hai.</p>
    <p><strong>You’re that person to me.</strong></p>
    <p>Sometimes, to receive something beautiful, You must go through heartbreak. Only then do you understand its value.</p>
    <p>In a world full of two-faced people, <strong>There you are—shining bright, fearless, filterless.</strong></p>
    <p>I am truly proud of you, my girl.</p>
    <p>I watched the sunset that day, And just like that— Another day passed in my life… A beautiful chapter of our friendship.</p>
